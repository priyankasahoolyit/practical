# use statistical methods to examine 
# the relationship between our variables of interest

# beavers dataset
# contains the body temp of 4 beavers captured every 10 mins
# over a day
# We want to examne difference in average body temp
# to evaluate whether body temp effected by activity

#H0: mean beaver temperature is not affected by activity
#H1: mean beaver temperature is affected by activity

?beavers
str(beaver2)

# vars we will need
# we will evaluate beaver temp and activity

# temp = continuous variable
# activity = categorical dichotomos variable
